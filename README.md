# Real Estate Investment Trust Analysis and Data Modeling in Python

### Overview:

This Project is a part of the "Data Analysis with Python" IBM course and aims to showcase data analysis skills in Python such as:

+ Developing Python code for cleaning and preparing data for analysis - including handling missing values, formatting, normalizing, and binning data;

+ Manipulating data using dataframes, summarizing data, understanding data distribution, performing correlation and creating data pipelines;

+ Performing exploratory data analysis and applying analytical techniques to a real-word dataset using libraries such as **_Pandas_**, **_Numpy_** and **_Scipy_**;

+ Building and evaluating regression models using machine learning **_scikit-learn library_** and using them for prediction and decision making.

I used **_Jupyter Notebook_** to Complete this Project (http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Desktop/IBM%20Data%20Analyst/Data%20Analysis%20with%20Python/Final%20Project%20-%20Data%20Analytics%20for%20House%20Pricing/House%20Sales%20in%20King%20County%20USA%20Analysis.ipynb).

### Scenario:

For this project, I assumed the role of a Data Analyst working at a Real Estate Investment Trust. The Trust would like to start investing in Residential real estate. I am tasked with determining the market price of a house given a set of features. I will analyze and predict housing prices using attributes or features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, number of floors, and so on. 

### Dataset:

The dataset contains house sale prices for King County, which includes Seattle. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015. It was taken from (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).
